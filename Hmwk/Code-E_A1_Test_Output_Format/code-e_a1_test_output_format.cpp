//Create a program that matches the output.  Review the expected 
//output by running and examine the inputs vs. the outputs.  You 
//succeed only when it matches.
//Run the provided template to see the outputs.  The test cases 
//won't pass until you read the input and match the output.
//Centered Dots in output represent spaces.
//Arrows represent end of line. 
//Blank Spaces represent Tabs.
//You will need to use spaces, \t, and endl's to obtain the output.
//Look at your output and the expected output very closely.
//Make sure you read in the integer and float values for output.
