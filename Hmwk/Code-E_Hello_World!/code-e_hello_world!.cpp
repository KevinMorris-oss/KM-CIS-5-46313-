//The book "The C Programming Language" by Kerningham and Ritchie defines
//the first program all programmers should code and compile on their
//platforms as "Hello World".  That being the case, this project will have
//you output Hello World on our on-line coding judge.  Note: The output
//displays spaces and carriage returns with dots and arrows. You must
//correctly output not only the string "Hello World", but also with the
//correct number of spaces and carriage returns!
